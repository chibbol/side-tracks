# side-tracks
Ahoy! :)
  There are many side projects of my current main ones however they are not important in the viewpoint of the goals, but I would like to keep them as well. Some of them are just exercises or "unexpected features". Maybe you will find something useful or you can learn from my mistakes. Enjoy it! :)
